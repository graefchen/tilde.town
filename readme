            tilde.town/~graefchen
       a website from me on tilde.town

                            pure [html|cs|js]

that is [minimal|versioned]

designed so it seems [modern|minimal], like a
smart[phone|watch], but also very lightweight
and performant on devices, using established
[css|js] that is not experimental on any
major browser

text-based browsers are for the first part
ignored, but could be added later

                      *

only the [html|css|js] files are uploaded
over sftp to the tilde.town server
